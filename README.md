# MIDI Chord GANerator

This project is a simple MIDI chord sequence generator written in C, with future plans to incorporate GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) for more advanced music composition. It allows users to input a sequence of chords, specify their durations, and generate a MIDI file with the given sequence. The program supports various chords, including major, minor, and seventh chords.

## Features

- Input chord sequences with durations
- Support for different time signatures (3/4 and 4/4)
- Generate MIDI files with specified chord sequences
- Repeat chord sequences multiple times
- Future integration with GANs for advanced music generation

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MIDI-Chord-GANerator.git
   cd MIDI-Chord-GANerator
